# Copilot Instructions

- Prefer **XUnit** as the testing framework.
- Use **Test Driven Development (TDD)** best practices:
  - Write tests before implementing new features or fixing bugs.
  - Ensure all new code is covered by unit tests.
  - Refactor code only when tests are passing.
  - Maintain fast, reliable, and isolated tests.
- Apply **.NET best practices**, including:
  - SOLID principles and Dependency Injection.
  - Async programming with async/await.
  - LINQ for efficient data manipulation.
  - Comprehensive unit and integration testing.
  - Secure coding practices following OWASP guidelines.
- Implement **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)** to separate read and write concerns.
- Use **MediatR for command and query handling**, ensuring decoupled communication between components.
- Use **FluentValidation** for model validation, ensuring clean and maintainable validation logic.
- Use **.NET Aspire** for app hosting and configuration, ensuring a clean separation of concerns.
- Avoid using "AutoMapper". Instead generate "To" methods when the source object needs to be mapped to a different object type.
- Use **Blazor** for building interactive web UIs, leveraging its component model.
- Use Microsoft SQL Server as the database, ensuring efficient data storage and retrieval.
- Use **Entity Framework Core** for data access, ensuring efficient and maintainable database interactions.
- Use **Bootstrap** for web site layout and styling, ensuring responsive and consistent UI design.
