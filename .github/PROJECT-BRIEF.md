# Project Brief: ThriftMedia Application and Services

## Project Overview
ThriftMedia is a digital platform designed to connect businesses and consumers through curated media experiences. The platform consists of four main components: a public-facing website, a business owner administration website, a mobile application, and a data ingestion backend. This project aims to develop and deploy these components with a strong emphasis on secure coding practices and compliance with OWASP Top Ten security recommendations 1.

## Objectives

- Public-Facing Website: Provide consumers with the ability to browse content, media, and business listings without registration. Registered users can manage their profiles, search and filter content, and view business promotions. The website will incorporate advertising to generate revenue and will use location services to enhance the user experience 1.
- Business Owner Administration Website: Enable business owners to manage their profiles, upload media, track analytics, and manage notifications. The website will support secure login and role-based access management 1.
- Mobile Application: Develop a mobile app for iOS and Android that allows store owners to capture and upload media, manage their profiles, and receive notifications. The app will support offline functionality and deep integration with device features 1.
- Data Ingestion Backend: Implement a backend system for automated data processing, real-time data input, data validation, and secure endpoints. The backend will support continuous monitoring and logging 1.
